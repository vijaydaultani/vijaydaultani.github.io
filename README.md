This is my personal website made using [Github Pages][] and [Jekyll][]. Here I maintain information related to my education, research, professional career and my contribution back to society. On this website I try to update as much information as possible. Since I work for projects in organisations which are not always open source and publicly available, therefore it is not always possible to add information about such projects due to confidentiality reasons. Hence this website will not contain information about all my experiences and projects.
