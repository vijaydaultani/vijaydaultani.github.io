## ðŸ”¬ Personal Research Projects

1. **Data Visualization using Seaborn**          
    I created a Notebook for exploration, visualisation and analysis of abalone datasets using python, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.    
    Code: [here](https://github.com/vijaydaultani/specimen/blob/master/visualization/seaborn_abalone.ipynb)

2. **Parallel Computation using MPI**      
  As a course project for CSV 880: Special Module in Parallel Computation, I implemented following two assignments.      
  â€¢ Assignment 1: Averaging based computations on a matrix using block-cyclic distribution.       
  â€¢ Assignment 2: Broadcasting on a 2D Torus using a single spanning tree.    
    Code: [here](https://github.com/vijaydaultani/CSV880)

3. **Pintos**  
  Pintos is a simple instructional operating system framework for the 80x86 processor architecture from Stanford University. As a course project for Resource management in Computer Science I implemented following modules in the framework of Pintos       
â€¢ Loading and running user programs.     
â€¢ Virtual Memory management.    
â€¢ File system.    

4. **CGRA**    
  Use LLVM to compile the computation intensive kernels in C into assembly code. A parser to 	identify data dependencies then parses the intermediate representation of code generated by LLVM and a DAG representing the data dependency is constructed. After which Instruction Legalisation, Scheduling and Mapping on CGRA is performed.    
  Code: [here](https://github.com/vijaydaultani/CSV880)

5. **NUCA**     
  Analysed energy breakdown of Static and Dynamic Non-Uniform Cache Access (NUCA). I measured the power consumption and collected heat generation patterns of NUCA architecture. Also interpreted inter banks link data access patterns.
