## About Me

<img class="dp" src="/assets/image/vijay.jpg">

As of autumn 2014 I am a Researcher at [NEC Central Research Laboratories](http://www.nec.com/en/global/rd/) in Tokyo Japan. My research interests spans the field of Deep Learning and High Performance Computing. My current research is to optimize and bridge the gap between Convolutional Neural Networks and Super Computers. In autumn 2015, I was a visting industrial fellow for a month on an IoT project optimizing for turn around time of an Elevator. This was a collaborative project in Swarm Lab of University of California, Berkeley ([UCB](http://www.berkeley.edu/)). In September 2010, I worked for [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/in-en), as an Associate Software Engineer, for around a year. 

I have experience of working on a wide range of application abstractions, ranging from creating sophisticated machine learning models, to the level where I get my hands dirty by debugging assembly level code for acceleration, and many others like parallel computation, software defined networking and IoT in between. Currently, I am working on different facets of Machine Learning, including but not limited to Regression, Classification, Deep Learning and Recommender systems. For details please visit my [research](research) and [academics](academics) page.

Previously I was a Computer Science Masters student at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi ([IIT Delhi](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/)), where I worked with [Prof. Anshul Kumar](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~anshul/) for designing and implementing the backend of compiler for CGRA architecture. My research in Masters centered on high performance computing, operating systems and compilers. I received Bachelors degree in Computer Science from Truba College of Engineering and Technology ([TCET](http://www.trubainstitute.ac.in/GROUP-OF-INSTITUTIONS/tcet_new)) under the guidance of [Prof. Ritu Tandon](http://www.trubainstitute.ac.in/GROUP-OF-INSTITUTIONS/tcet_new/info.php?show=351).
