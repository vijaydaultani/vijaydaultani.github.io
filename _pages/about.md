As of March 2024, I completed my PhD in Natural Language Processing under [Prof. Naoaki Okazaki](https://www.chokkan.org/) at the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/), where my research focused on modeling linguistic acceptability using language models and coarse sentence representations.

Previously, I was Group Manager for Natural Language Processing at [Rakuten](https://global.rakuten.com/corp/) (2021–2023), leading a team of researchers and engineers. I spearheaded impactful initiatives across E-Commerce, Finance, and Travel domains—including a keyword ad bidding optimizer, and a knowledge graph-based item attribute extractor.

Before that, I worked at [Amazon Japan](https://www.amazon.co.jp/) (2019–2021) as a Sr. Technical Program Manager in the Applied Machine Learning group. There, I led cross-functional ML projects spanning 13 countries, contributed to the development of a Japanese tokenizer used across six business use cases, and spearheaded the development of a sequence-to-sequence ad generation system integrated with Google Ads.

Between 2017 and 2019, I was promoted to lead the NLP group at Rakuten, leading a cross-functional R&D team of researchers and engineers. I helped establish the Rakuten India research lab, launched a deep learning fraud detection platform for credit card transactions, and co-founded the AI Trainers initiative to mentor ML talent across the company.

Earlier, from 2014 to 2017, I worked as a Researcher at [NEC Central Research Laboratories](http://www.nec.com/en/global/rd/), where I developed efficient deep learning algorithms for NEC’s SX-ACE Supercomputer. My contributions led to up to 95% speed-up for state-of-the-art CNNs. During this time, I also completed a one-month research stint as a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley’s [Swarm Lab](https://bamlab.berkeley.edu/wiki/swarm_lab), leading a collaborative IoT project focused on optimizing user decisions in vertical mobility systems (elevators, escalators, stairs).

I began my career at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/in-en) as an Associate Software Engineer in 2010, before transitioning into research through my M.Tech at [IIT Delhi](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/), where I worked on CGRA compilers under [Prof. Anshul Kumar](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~anshul/). My undergraduate degree is in Computer Science from [TCET Indore](http://www.trubainstitute.ac.in/GROUP-OF-INSTITUTIONS/tcet_new), where I studied under [Prof. Ritu Tandon](http://www.trubainstitute.ac.in/GROUP-OF-INSTITUTIONS/tcet_new/info.php?show=351).

My expertise spans NLP, deep learning, high-performance computing, and AI-driven business solutions. I’m passionate about translating academic research into real-world impact, particularly through building intelligent systems and driving applied innovation.
