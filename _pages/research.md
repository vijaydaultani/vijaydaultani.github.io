## Publications
My research focuses on enhancing the reliability and interpretability of language understanding systems and improving the efficiency of deep learning models. I am particularly interested in the evaluation of sentence acceptability and how language models can be guided by structured representations and human judgments. I also focus on unsupervised methods for information extraction and summarization in real-world applications like e-commerce. Another key area of interest is the integration of external signals, such as weather data, to improve predictive modeling. Overall, my work aims to bridge linguistic insights with practical, scalable machine learning solutions.

## Personal Research Projects

1. **Data Visualization using Seaborn**          
  I explored and visualized the Abalone dataset using Seaborn to uncover patterns in physical measurements and age classification. My work involved generating insightful plots such as pair plots, box plots, and heatmaps to analyze correlations and distributions across attributes. These visualizations aided in identifying relationships between features like shell dimensions and the number of rings (a proxy for age), supporting further predictive modeling efforts.    
  [[Code](https://github.com/vijaydaultani/specimen/blob/master/visualization/seaborn_abalone.ipynb)]

2. **Parallel Computation using MPI**      
  As part of my coursework in parallel computation, I developed two high-performance computing assignments using MPI. In the first, I implemented a matrix averaging algorithm using block-cyclic distribution over a 2D process grid to optimize load balancing. In the second, I designed an efficient broadcast mechanism over a 2D torus network using multiple non-contending spanning trees to reduce network congestion.

3. **Pintos**  
  This project involves extending the Pintos operating system, a teaching OS for the 80x86 architecture developed at Stanford. As part of a course on Resource Management in Computer Science, key modules were implemented: user program loading, virtual memory management, and file system support. The work enhances Pintos’ capability to handle user-space programs, manage memory efficiently, and perform file operations.

4. **Energy Breakdown of Static and Dynamic Non-Uniform Cache Access**     
  This project focuses on analyzing energy consumption in Static and Dynamic Non-Uniform Cache Access (NUCA) architectures. It investigates power usage, heat generation patterns, and inter-bank data access behaviors. The study includes experiments comparing cache mapping policies, identifying high power-consuming areas, and evaluating hop counts under different write policies.
